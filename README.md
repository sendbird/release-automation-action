# release-automation-action

This GitHub Action is designed to be used as a comment bot in a release automation process.

When an PR comment is created, the action will check if the comment contains a specific command and then execute an action based on the command.
If the conditions are met, the script extracts a command from the comment and runs it.

## Usage

To use this action, create a new workflow in your GitHub repository that listens for issue_comment events, but only for Pull Request comments.

Then, add the following step to the workflow:

```yaml
name: PR Comment Bot
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  pr-comment:
    if: ${{ github.event.issue.pull_request }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: sendbird/release-automation-action@latest
        with:
          gh_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          circleci_token: ${{ secrets.CIRCLECI_TOKEN }}
          product: 'uikit'
          platform: 'rn'
          product_jira_project_key: 'UIKIT'
          product_jira_version_prefix: 'rn_uikit'
```

Replace version with the version of the action you want to use.

Make sure to set the required secret CircleCI API token in the repository settings.
